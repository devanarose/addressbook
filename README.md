An address book or a name and address book is a book, or a database used for storing entries, called addressbook. 
Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: name, address and phone number).
Most such systems store the details in alphabetical order of people's names, although in paper-based address books entries can easily end up out of order as the owner inserts details of more individuals or as people move.
